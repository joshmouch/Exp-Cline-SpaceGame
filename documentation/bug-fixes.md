## Rocket Initial Position Bug Fix

### Issue
The rocket was starting nose-down at the 10-o'clock position relative to Earth rather than nose-up at the 12-o'clock position as expected. Additionally, there was inconsistency between the initial position when the game first loads and after the game is reset using the Reset button.

### Root Causes
1. Insufficient margin in distance calculations leading to collision detection issues
2. Inconsistent handling of the special case for the 12-o'clock position
3. `resetGame()` function was using the current game time for orbit calculations, while `init()` used the current timestamp
4. Orbital update function treated landed rocket positioning inconsistently for top-of-Earth positions

### Fixes Applied

#### In `js/main.js`:
1. Updated `resetGame()` to:
   - Use a fixed initial time (0) for consistent planet positioning
   - Reset all celestial bodies to their initial orbital positions 
   - Explicitly position the rocket at the 12-o'clock position with nose up
   - Add a margin to prevent collision issues

2. Updated `init()` to:
   - Use the same fixed initial time as `resetGame()`
   - Use the same celestial body positioning logic
   - Position the rocket consistently with `resetGame()`
   - Add detailed logging

3. Added a helper function `getParentBody()` to find parent bodies for orbital calculations

#### In `js/entities/rocket.js`:
1. Updated `getInitialRocketState()` to:
   - Add a 1-pixel margin to prevent collision issues
   - Add logging to help with debugging
   - Keep the correct angle calculation for 12-o'clock position

2. Updated `checkLanding()` to:
   - Add special case handling for landing near the top of Earth (12-o'clock position)
   - Use -Math.PI angle when at the top to point straight up

3. Updated `launchFromBody()` to:
   - Add a 1-pixel margin to prevent collision during launch

#### In `js/entities/orbits.js`:
1. Updated `updateOrbits()` to:
   - Separate the body position update from the rocket position update
   - Add special case for the top of Earth (12-o'clock position)
   - Add margin in rocket positioning to prevent collision
   - Ensure consistent rocket orientation

#### In `js/physics.js`:
1. Updated `applyGravity()` to:
   - Prevent gravity from affecting the rocket when landed
   - Add special case for the top of Earth (12-o'clock position)
   - Ensure consistent positioning when landed at the top

### Tests
1. Created a new Playwright test (`rocket-initial-position.test.js`) that verifies:
   - The rocket starts at the 12-o'clock position (top of Earth)
   - The rocket is positioned properly with the correct distance from Earth's center
   - The rocket is pointing straight up (-Math.PI angle)
   - The rocket doesn't fall through Earth after initialization

2. Created a new test (`rocket-reset.test.js`) that verifies:
   - The rocket position after reset is the same as after a page reload
   - The rocket maintains consistent position and orientation in both cases

### Validation
The tests take screenshots at these stages:
1. Initial game state
2. After movement
3. After reset
4. After page reload

The tests verify that:
1. The rocket is properly positioned at the 12-o'clock position in all cases
2. The rocket orientation is consistent (nose-up)
3. There is no fall-through issue after reset or page load

### Related Changes
These fixes ensure that the rocket's position and orientation are consistent between game starts and resets, eliminating the 10-o'clock nose-down positioning bug and ensuring the game behaves predictably after reset.
